While this is not required, real-world HTML websites usually follow this template. Paragraphs, headings, and most other content go inside the ```body``` tag, which is inside the ```html``` tag. Note how everything is inside the ```html``` tag.
```
<html>
    <body>
        <p>Hi!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Note how the code is formatted. Tags are indented more when they are inside another tag. For example, the ```p``` tag is inside the ```body``` tag, so it is indented more. This is not required, but it makes it more obvious which tags are inside other tags.
