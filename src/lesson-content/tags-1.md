HTML code is made of tags that represent parts of a website.

Each tag has a name. For example, tags with the name ```p``` are paragraphs while tags with the name ```b``` are bold text. Here are some more names:
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Definition</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>p</td><td>paragraph</td></tr>
        <tr><td>h1</td><td>1st largest header</td></tr>
        <tr><td>b</td><td>bold</td></tr>
        <tr><td>i</td><td>italic</td></tr>
        <tr><td>u</td><td>underline</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Each tag also has a space to put things inside them. Whatever you put inside a tag becomes part of the tag. If you put the words "Hello world" inside a ```p``` tag, you get a paragraph with "Hello world" in it. If you don't put anything inside a paragraph tag, you will get an empty paragraph that has nothing in it.

Tags look like this in the code:
```
<tagname>[THINGS INSIDE THE TAG]</tagname>
```

The ```<tagname>``` part marks where the tag begins, while the ```</tagname>``` part marks where the tag ends. These two parts surround what is inside the tag.

For example, for a paragraph that says "Hi":
* use a ```p``` tag because ```p``` is for paragraphs
* add the words "Hi" inside the tag

Result: ```<p>Hi</p>```
